# Delivery-Auxiliary-System
Single stop case:  The system will be given a start point geolocation and end point geolocation and vehicle type: car, bike. The solution should use existing Map APIs like Google Maps to get estimated time and path to be taken to reach from starting point to end point.  Multi stop case: The system will be given a start point, end point and series of way points in between in the order they have to be visited in. It will be as (start point, point A, point B, ..... , end point) where each point is a geolocation tuple. The solution should use the existing Map APIs like Google Maps to get estimated time and path to be taken to reach from start point to end point with a breakup of time required to go from each point to its subsequent point.  Simulation tool: Using SymPy library, create a simulation tool to simulate path execution. The simulation tool should be able to simulate multi operator multi path execution and display the results graphically. The simulation should be able to add disturbances in the execution of the path randomly and report the time taken to execute the path vs time expected.
